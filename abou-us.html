            The defining idea came from Paul and Adolf Daimler, the sons of the
            company founder who had died several years earlier in 1900: they
            adapted a three-pointed star for use as the brand logo. Their
            father, Gottlieb Daimler, had used a symbol like this one to mark
            the family's house on a postcard depicting a view of the town of
            Deutz during his time as technical director of Gasmotorenfabrik
            Deutz.

          <h4>The first automobile</h4>
          <p>
            The first stationary gasoline engine developed by Carl Benz was a
            one-cylinder two-stroke unit which ran for the first time on New
            Yearâ€™s Eve 1879. Benz had so much commercial success with this
            engine that he was able to devote more time to his dream of creating
            a lightweight car powered by a gasoline engine, in which the chassis
            and engine formed a single unit.
